# Internet Consumption and Its Analytics
 ## PROBLEM STATEMENT
 The internet was invented on January 1, 1983. Since then it has grown exponentially. The majority of the countries in today’s world have access to the Internet
 A larger amount of data related to the Internet is being generated daily. But this data mostly goes unused, or Instead of this we can use it for the greater good by analyzing and
 getting better insights about it which can help to change the world.
 So In this repo  We’ll be analyzing and visualizing the internet consumption data around the world to derive insights to check why some countries are having less access to the internet than other countries and where they are lacking.
## DATASET
* dataset from Kaggle.
It is a Worldwide data from 1960 to 2019 which consists of the Internet and the Evolution of Broadband around the world.
We are focusing on main attributes like
Total Population Internet Users , Fixed (wired) broadband subscriptions ,Mobile cellular subscriptions region, country-code, year.

 

 

## Broadband  

This chart shows the number of fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 people as we can observe that it gives difference i.e decreasing with 400 units from 2010 t0 2019      . 
This refers to fixed subscriptions to high-speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. Means of connection include cable modem,  
DSL, fiber-to-the-home, other fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions, satellite broadband and terrestrial fixed wireless broadband. Excluded are subscriptions via mobile-cellular networks. 

 

 

 ## Internet users 
 
 The Internet has been one of our most transformative and fast-growing technologies. But the question is  how many people from each country are online?  In this bar graph  we see the total number of users by country, for analysis we have taken top 10 countries named  France , Belgium, Austria , Japan ,Mexico Denmark south korea ,finland  and Portugal so the berlgium is the maximum count of 128 and followed by finland to be lowest count of 126 internet users  among these countries. So here ,we  can see that another  bar graph shares with us that the highest internet usage from 2000-2009 in individuals that the year  2000 has the highest used of internet in individuals i.e 630 where it abruptly decreases in 2009 by 402. 

 

 

 

 

## Mobile subscription.  

A truly disruptive technological development has been the rise of mobile phones. The interactive visualization shows the latest global data. We have taken Top 10 Mobile Cellular Subscriptions per 100 people From 2007 to 2016.  
By changing to the line chart view you can see that globally we only saw a very slow rise from 2008 to 2009  but coming to the year 2012 to 2014 there is no change in count of subscriptions  and then a dramatically faster increase in mobile device subscriptions in the year 2015 but according to our statistics 2016 gives the count of 794  which is slightly lower that 2015. 

 

## Share people is online 

The graph shows the share of the population that is accessing the internet for all countries of the world. Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location) from 2009 to 2018 .  The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc. 
According to our statistics we get the right skewed visualization which is showing that graph is slowly increasing till 2017 i.e 8.79 percent which the peak year and sudden game changer occurs that in 2018 we get drastical decrease by 3% as being compared to 2017   i.e 5.058 percentage  share of people being online. 

## Number of internet user by country 

The bar graph shows Number of Internet user by top 10 countries which includes Belgium,France, hong kong, Austria, japan, Portugal, Mexico, Denmark south korea , finland where Belgium, France and hong kong has the highest rate 128 of internet usage and Autria ,japan, Portugal has  127 i.e one percent difference then above countries and the lowest countries of internet user with 126 are Mexico, Denmark, south korea and finland. 

 

 
## Expected and proposed solutions

• Reducing taxes 

• Having Zero rating programs

• Providing diverse and uncensored content over the internet

• Expand digital infrastructure

• Strengthen the digital literacy
  These are a number of ways to improve
  technology access which brings the benefits of a robust and open Internet to people which leads to digitalization around the world.
